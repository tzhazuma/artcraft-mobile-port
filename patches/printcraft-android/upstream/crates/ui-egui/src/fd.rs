//! Where the file dialogs come from.
//!
//! Desktop builds ask `rfd`, which has a backend for macOS, Windows, Linux and the web. Android
//! has none: `rfd` 0.17 does not compile for it at all (its platform traits have no
//! implementation there), and an Android picker must be started on the UI thread and answered
//! later — which a blocking dialog can never do, because the frame that would receive the answer
//! is the frame it blocks.
//!
//! So every dialog in this crate asks this module, never `rfd` directly:
//!
//! - on the platforms `rfd` supports the two types *are* `rfd`'s, unchanged;
//! - on Android a host installs itself with [`set_host`] (the app shell does: see
//!   `apps/printcraft-android`, which drives the Storage Access Framework). The synchronous
//!   dialogs then answer immediately — a *save* reserves a file in the app's own storage and the
//!   host publishes it to the destination the user picks afterwards; an *open* answers
//!   "cancelled", because a pick can only come back on a later frame (File ▸ Open uses the
//!   asynchronous dialog, which exists for exactly that reason);
//! - with no host installed every dialog answers "cancelled": the app keeps running and can open
//!   files by path, it just cannot ask for one.
